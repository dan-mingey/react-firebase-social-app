# My Social App

## Overview

This project is a simple templated ReactJS website designed for social interactions. It integrates seamlessly with Firebase, providing backend services like authentication and data storage without needing to manage servers or write server-side code.

## Requirements

- Node.js (LTS version recommended, e.g., Node.js 14.x or higher)
- npm (typically comes with Node.js)
- A modern web browser that supports ES6 (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url-here.com
   cd my-social-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Navigate to the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Firebase Configuration**

   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Set up Authentication and Firestore Database in your Firebase project.
   - Replace the firebase configuration in the `src/firebase.js` with your Firebase project settings.

   Example of `firebase.js`:

   ```javascript
   import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
   import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
   import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
     projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
   };

   const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
   export const auth = getAuth(app);
   export const db = getFirestore(app);
   ```

4. Start the Development Server. Run the following command to start the development server:

```
npm start
```

This will launch the app in your default web browser. The development server typically runs at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

After setting up, you can navigate through the website using the pre-built routes:

- `/signin`: Login page
- `/signup`: Registration page
- `/`: Home page (requires authentication)
  Additional authenticated routes include profile, settings, and messages pages.

## Deployment

For production, you can build the project using:
```
npm run build
```
